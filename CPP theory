1. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐂++

Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold. In C++, there are various data types, which can be categorized into primitive and derived data types.

𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬:

𝐢𝐧𝐭: Used to store integers (whole numbers).
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: int age = 25;

𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐭: Used for single-precision floating-point numbers (decimal values).
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: float height = 5.9;

𝐝𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞: Used for double-precision floating-point numbers. Offers more precision than float.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: double weight = 72.356;

𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫: Used to store single characters.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: char grade = 'A';

𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐥: Used to store Boolean values (true or false).
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: bool isActive = true;

𝐃𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬:

𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲: Collection of elements of the same type.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫: Stores memory address of another variable.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: int* ptr = &age;

𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: Sequence of characters (not a built-in type but provided via libraries like <string>).
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: string name = "John";

𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: User-defined data type for grouping different types.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:
struct Person {
    string name;
    int age;
};

𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬:

𝐄𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬: Used for defining named integer constants.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

enum Day { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday };

Day today = Sunday;

𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧: Stores different data types in the same memory location but can only hold one value at a time.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
};

2. 𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐂++

A variable is a name given to a memory location used to store a value. Variables in C++ must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.

𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

int num;           // Declaration
num = 10;          // Initialization
float pi = 3.14;   // Declaration + Initialization

𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬:

Local Variables: Declared inside a function or block, accessible only within that scope.

𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬: Declared outside all functions, accessible to all functions in the program.

𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒄 𝑽𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆𝒔: Retain their value between multiple function calls.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

static int count = 0;

Variable Naming Rules:

Must begin with a letter or underscore.

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.

No special characters or spaces allowed.

3. 𝐀𝐒𝐂𝐈𝐈 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐂++

𝐀𝐒𝐂𝐈𝐈 (𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞) is a character encoding standard that represents characters as integers. Each character (letters, digits, symbols) has a corresponding ASCII value.

𝐀𝐒𝐂𝐈𝐈 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

The ASCII value of 'A' is 65.

The ASCII value of 'a' is 97.

The ASCII value of '0' is 48.

How to Use ASCII in C++:

Common ASCII Values: 

Character	             ASCII Value
  'A'	                    65
  'a'	                    97
  '0'                     48
  ' '(space)	            32
  '$'	                    36
  '@'	                    64


You can find the ASCII value of any character using type casting:

char ch = 'A';

cout << "The ASCII value of " << ch << " is: " << int(ch) << endl;

Common ASCII Values:

CharacterASCII Value'A'65'a'97'0'48' ' (space)32'$'36'@'644. 

𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐂++:-

Comments are non-executable lines in the code that help in explaining the purpose or functionality of the code. Comments can make your code more readable and maintainable.

𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞-𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:

Single-line comments start with // and end at the end of the line.

// 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞-𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭

int x = 10; // This comment explains the variable declaration

𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. They are used to comment out multiple lines at once.

/* This is a 

   multi-line comment

   in C++ programming */

int y = 20;

Best Practices for Comments:

Use comments to explain why, not what: Good code should be self-explanatory.

𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫-𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: 

Too many comments can make the code cluttered.

Keep comments up to date: If the code changes, update the comments accordingly.

𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:

You can use comments to temporarily disable certain lines of code during debugging.

In documentation tools (like Doxygen), comments can be used for generating documentation.

5. 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐬

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐬:

Modifiers are used with data types to change the size and range.

𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐞𝐝: Can hold positive and negative values.

𝐮𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐞𝐝: Can only hold non-negative values.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: unsigned int age = 30;

𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭: Takes less memory.

𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠: Takes more memory.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: long int largeNumber = 1000000;

𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠:

Type casting is converting one data type to another.

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Done automatically by the compiler.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

int a = 5;

float b = a;  // Implicit casting

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Done manually by the programmer.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

float x = 10.5;

int y = (int)x;  // Explicit casting

𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲:

Data Types define the kind of values that variables can hold.

Variables store values and are essential for any computation.

ASCII Table helps in converting characters to their numeric representation.

Comments make code readable, maintainable, and easier to debug.

By understanding these foundational concepts in C++, you can write clearer, more efficient, and more maintainable code as you progress in your learning journey.

𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬 & 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬:-

1. 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐂++:

Type conversions refer to the process of converting one data type to another. There are two types of type conversions in C++:

- 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧)

- 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠)

1.1 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:

- Implicit conversion is automatically done by the compiler when it     encounters data types that are compatible.

- The compiler promotes smaller data types to larger ones to avoid data loss.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    float result = num;  // int is implicitly converted to float
    cout << "Implicit conversion of int to float: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

1.2 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠):

Explicit conversion (also known as type casting) is done manually by the programmer when automatic conversion may lead to data loss or is not performed by the compiler.

𝐒𝐲𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐱: Type(variable)

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float num = 3.14;
    int result = (int)num;  // Explicitly cast float to int
    cout << "Explicit conversion of float to int: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭: Explicit conversion of float to int: 3


2. 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬 & 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬

2.1 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬

- Macros are preprocessor directives that define constants or expressions.

- #define is used to define a macro in C++.

- Macros are evaluated before the program is compiled, which makes them efficient but can sometimes lead to errors if not used carefully.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 - 𝐒𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

#include <iostream>
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))  // Macro for calculating square
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is: " << SQUARE(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}

2.2 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬

- The <climits> header in C++ contains type range macros that give the maximum and minimum values for different data types (like int, char, etc.).

  𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨	          𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
 INT_MAX	      Maximum value of int
 INT_MIN	     Minimum value of int
 CHAR_MAX	     Maximum value of char
 CHAR_MIN	     Minimum value of char
 LONG_MAX	     Maximum value of long
 LONG_MIN	     Minimum value of long


𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 - 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬:

#include <iostream>
#include <climits>  // For type range macros
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "The maximum value of int: " << INT_MAX << endl;
    cout << "The minimum value of int: " << INT_MIN << endl;
    cout << "The maximum value of char: " << (int)CHAR_MAX << endl;  // Cast to int for readability
    cout << "The minimum value of char: " << (int)CHAR_MIN << endl;

    return 0;
}
